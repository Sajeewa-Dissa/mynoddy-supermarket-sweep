# mynoddy-supermarket-sweep
A webapp hosted in Azure running on the Asp.Net MVC framework.
This is an online shopping game. A link to the website can be found in the "main" project in my Github Pages share. 
The website uses JQuery, Bootstrap, Modernizr, Unity.Mvc DI package as well as others.
Webpage Layouts use grid displays and are fully responsive.

The online store is based on an example in the book Pro ASP.NET MVC 5 by Adam Freeman 2013.
The win-condition animation on the results screen is taken from the following Codepen "https://codepen.io/soulwire/pen/foktm".
